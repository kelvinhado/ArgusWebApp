##User Flow

Main objective : find out if an ad (from lbc) is a good deal after comparing with Cote Argus.

1) The user has to find our application via Google or by typing the URL.

2) He has to copy the LBC Ad's URL in the search bar. (Just like a youtube converter)

3) Our application will tell the user if the AD is a good deal or not, and how good or bad it is.

4) The server will see if the description from the lbc page match perfectly with a car in lacentrale.fr, if not the user will have to chose among several options provided by the server to have the perfect match

5) Possibility to search several offers and make a list out of the results, sorted by how good the deals are.
